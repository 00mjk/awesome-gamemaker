# Contributing Guidelines

Before submitting new links or making a pull request, please review the following information in order for your links to be included.

## New Links

New suggested links **need to be related to GMS2.3+ in some reasonable way.** This includes compatible libraries, guides, blog posts, YouTube videos, etc.
I'm trying to avoid GMS1-exclusive content, so please only submit links related to GMS2.3+.
For extensions or GMS2 projects, please link an official Itch.io or repository (Github/Gitlab/etc).
For example, I'm trying to avoid project dumps on Google drives that have no version control.

So for each link, include each link with the following format:

`[Awesome Example](https://github.com/bytecauldron/awesome-gamemaker)` - A short description

Additionally, include whether or not it's a paid asset ðŸ’¸ and if it falls under an existing category.

## Creating Issues

Issues can be created for spelling/list errors, pruning dead links, or specifying if asset is now free or paid.
Authors can also ask for the removal of their content, if requested.

Suggestions for new categories, links, and better descriptions are encouraged and should also be submitted as issues.

Merging forks should be fine if it adds a large amount of new resources and they have been organized similarly to the existing list.

## Additional Feedback

If you have a better way to organize the list information or other ideas, please share them by opening up a new issue.
