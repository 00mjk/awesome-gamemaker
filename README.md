# Awesome GameMaker 2 [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
An awesome list of 100+ libraries, snippets, guides, and projects for GameMaker Studio 2. üòé

Many libraries here will completely replace native tools in the IDE. I highly recommend exploring everything here so you can start making games as quickly as possible!

This is based on a list from [GameMaker Libraries](https://github.com/FaultyFunctions/GameMakerLibraries) and from Gleb Tsereteli's [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wUm8FZPm8AKLZgC-P76TPJAMXs0EN2s5mJGvvUFwycw/edit). I just categorized it and added some additional links/details. If you need more general game development resources, check out [Awesome Gamedev](https://notabug.org/Calinou/awesome-gamedev).

üí∏ are premium assets. Everything else is free. Most stuff here is licensed MIT/CC/GPL but double check before you use these in your commercial projects.

## Getting Started üî•

Here are some recommendations when using GMS2. You don't have to follow them but it might save you some time/energy.

- Recommended to avoid the DND (Drag and Drop) feature. Learn GML instead.
- The native sprite editor is not very robust. Try AESprite instead.
- Don't be afraid to use other developer libraries. A lot of them are free for a reason.
- Updates to the IDE and runtime can break your game (like syntax changes to GML). If you are working in a group, make sure you are running on the same version of GMS2 and only update when given a fair warning. You can reinstall previous versions of your IDE at the GMS2 download page.
- Unless your game requires complex physics interactions, it's generally advised to avoid GMS2's built-in physics system.
