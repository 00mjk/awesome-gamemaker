# Awesome GameMaker 2 [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
An awesome list of great libraries, snippets, guides, and projects for GameMaker 2.

A majority of these libraries I use in my personal and commercial projects. Many of them will completely replace native tools in the IDE. If you have used GameMaker long enough, you know why some of these are an "absolute nessesity" for building larger commercial games. I highly recommend exploring everything here so you can start making games as quick as possible!

Please note that older libraries will not be included from GameMaker 1 unless they have been updated.

This is based on a list from [FaultyFunctions](https://github.com/FaultyFunctions/GameMakerLibraries) and the resource [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wUm8FZPm8AKLZgC-P76TPJAMXs0EN2s5mJGvvUFwycw/edit). I just categorized it and added some additional links/details.
